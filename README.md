# Rock_vs_Mine
This is a project , where an ML model is trained to differentiate between Rock and a Mine by sonar sound used by a submarine
This project was an incredible learning experience, and here’s a quick breakdown of what I accomplished:

Dataset: Used a sonar dataset containing 208 instances of sonar reflections.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and analyzed the data using Pandas and NumPy.

Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets, and trained a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-Learn.

Accuracy: Achieved an impressive accuracy of XX% on the training data and 73% on the test data!

Prediction: The model can now take real-time input and predict whether the object is a Rock or a Mine.

Here’s a glimpse of the code and the process:
1️⃣ Loaded and explored the dataset.
2️⃣ Split the data into features (X) and labels (Y).
3️⃣ Trained the model and evaluated its performance.
4️⃣ Tested the model with a sample input to classify it as a Rock or a Mine.

This project not only strengthened my understanding of Machine Learning but also gave me hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
